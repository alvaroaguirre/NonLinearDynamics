# Non-Linear Dynamics

I have recently started to study Non-Linear Dynamics and chaotic systems, and I find it fascinating! So why not share some of the R code I am building here, in case you are interested in Chaos too.

## Very short introduction to Nonlinearity

_“It used to be thought that the events that changed the world were things like big bombs, maniac politicians, huge earthquakes, or vast population movements, but it has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought. The things that change the world, according to Chaos theory, are the tiny things. A butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazonian jungle, and subsequently a storm ravages half of Europe.”_
